# FalsoPay Architectural Patterns

This document outlines the architectural patterns used in the FalsoPay system and explains why each pattern was chosen.

## 1. Microservices Architecture

FalsoPay is built using a microservices architecture, which divides the application into loosely coupled, independently deployable services.

**Why this pattern?**
- **Scalability**: Each service can be scaled independently based on demand (e.g., the transaction processing service might need more resources than the user management service)
- **Resilience**: Failure in one service doesn't bring down the entire system
- **Technology Flexibility**: Different services can use different technologies based on specific requirements
- **Independent Development**: Teams can work on different services simultaneously without tight coordination
- **Easier Maintenance**: Smaller, focused codebases are easier to understand and maintain

## 2. API Gateway Pattern

An API Gateway serves as the single entry point for all client requests, routing them to appropriate microservices.

**Why this pattern?**
- **Simplified Client Interface**: Clients only need to know about a single endpoint
- **Security**: Centralized authentication and authorization
- **Cross-cutting Concerns**: Handles common functionality like logging, rate limiting, and monitoring
- **Protocol Translation**: Can translate between web protocols and internal protocols
- **Request Aggregation**: Can combine results from multiple services for a single client request

## 3. Event-Driven Architecture

FalsoPay uses event-driven architecture for handling transactions and notifications.

**Why this pattern?**
- **Decoupling**: Services communicate through events without direct dependencies
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Enables handling of high-volume transactions without blocking
- **Real-time Updates**: Facilitates immediate notifications for account activities
- **Audit Trail**: Events provide a natural audit log for all system activities
- **Scalability**: Easily scales to handle varying loads of transactions

## 4. CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

The system separates read operations (queries) from write operations (commands).

**Why this pattern?**
- **Performance Optimization**: Read and write operations can be optimized separately
- **Scalability**: Read-heavy operations (like checking balances) can be scaled independently from write operations (like processing payments)
- **Security**: Easier to implement different security models for reads vs. writes
- **Simplified Models**: Simpler domain models for specific operations

## 5. Repository Pattern

Data access is abstracted through repositories, providing a collection-like interface for accessing domain objects.

**Why this pattern?**
- **Abstraction**: Hides data access implementation details from the business logic
- **Testability**: Facilitates unit testing by allowing mock repositories
- **Centralized Data Logic**: Consolidates data access logic in one place
- **Consistency**: Enforces consistent data access patterns across the application

## 6. Circuit Breaker Pattern

Implemented for external service calls (like banking APIs) to prevent cascading failures.

**Why this pattern?**
- **Fault Tolerance**: Prevents repeated calls to failing services
- **Graceful Degradation**: System can continue operating with reduced functionality
- **Self-healing**: Automatically tests recovery of failed services
- **Resource Protection**: Prevents resource exhaustion during outages

## 7. Saga Pattern

Used for managing distributed transactions across multiple services.

**Why this pattern?**
- **Data Consistency**: Maintains consistency across services without distributed transactions
- **Compensation**: Provides mechanisms to undo partial transactions
- **Visibility**: Makes complex transaction flows explicit and traceable
- **Resilience**: Handles partial failures gracefully

## 8. MVC Pattern (Modified for Microservices)

While traditional MVC is adapted for our microservices environment:

**Why this pattern?**
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clearly separates data (Model), user interface (View), and control logic (Controller)
- **Maintainability**: Changes to one component don't affect others
- **Testability**: Each component can be tested independently
- **Parallel Development**: Different team members can work on models, views, and controllers simultaneously

## 9. Dependency Injection

Used throughout the system to manage component dependencies.

**Why this pattern?**
- **Loose Coupling**: Components depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations
- **Testability**: Dependencies can be easily mocked for testing
- **Configurability**: Dependencies can be changed without modifying code
- **Lifecycle Management**: Centralized control over object creation and disposal

## Conclusion

The combination of these architectural patterns enables FalsoPay to achieve its goals of being a secure, scalable, and maintainable payment system. Each pattern addresses specific concerns in the system's architecture, from handling distributed transactions (Saga) to ensuring system resilience (Circuit Breaker) to optimizing for different types of operations (CQRS).
