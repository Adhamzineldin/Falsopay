# 🟢 FalsoPay – Software Engineering Project Task Breakdown 🔥

## 📚 Documentation Breakdown (Everyone contributes)
Each of us will be responsible for writing/documenting 1 major part of the required docs:

1️⃣ **Introduction** – ✅  
Overview of the system, problem statement, and objectives.

2️⃣ **Functional Requirements** – ✅  
List and define all features the system must support.

3️⃣ **Non-Functional Requirements** – ✅  
Performance, scalability, security, usability, etc.

4️⃣ **All Diagrams** – ✅  
Use case, sequence, activity, class, component, deployment.

5️⃣ **Final Documentation** – ✅  
Compiling everything, formatting, and making it presentable.

➡ We’ll split these 5 sections equally and help each other finalize and polish the whole document.

## 🛠 Implementation Breakdown
We’ll split coding based on difficulty and experience:

### 👨‍💻 Backend Developers (Laravel – PHP + MySQL)
🟥 **Hard Difficulty**
- **Adham Zineldin**
- **[Assign Name]**

#### Responsibilities:
- **API Development**: Design and develop RESTful APIs using Laravel for various features like user authentication, transactions, etc.
- **Database Integration**: Implement database queries to interact with the MySQL database and manage data.
- **Business Logic**: Write and optimize the business logic for features like payment processing, balance checks, etc.
- **Authentication**: Implement secure login systems (e.g., JWT, OAuth2).
- **Error Handling**: Ensure robust error handling and logging throughout the backend.
- **Integration with Frontend**: Provide data to the frontend as per requirements and handle data fetching efficiently.
- **Security**: Ensure the backend system is secure, implementing encryption, validation, and protection against SQL injections and other security risks.

### 👩‍💻 Frontend Developers (React)
🟧 **Medium Difficulty**
- **[Assign Name]**
- **[Assign Name]**

#### Responsibilities:
- **UI Design & Development**: Implement the user interface for the application using React.
- **Component Development**: Create reusable and modular React components.
- **State Management**: Manage application state (e.g., using React Context or Redux).
- **API Integration**: Fetch data from the backend and display it in the frontend.
- **UI/UX Optimization**: Ensure the frontend is intuitive, user-friendly, and visually appealing.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure the application works across all screen sizes and devices.
- **Form Validation**: Implement form validation for user inputs.
- **Front-End Testing**: Write unit and integration tests for React components.

### 🧪 Tester (Frontend + Backend)
🟩 **Easiest Difficulty**
- **[Assign Name]**

#### Responsibilities:
- **Test Planning**: Develop test plans to ensure the entire application meets the functional requirements.
- **Unit Testing**: Write and execute unit tests for both frontend and backend components.
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure that both the frontend and backend work seamlessly together.
- **Bug Reporting**: Identify bugs and work with developers to resolve them.
- **Test Documentation**: Maintain documentation of test cases and test results.
- **Automation**: Work on automating repetitive test cases if necessary.
- **Performance Testing**: Test the application's performance to ensure that it meets the scalability requirements.

### 🧑‍💻 Database Developer (MySQL)
🟦 **Medium Difficulty**
- **[Assign Name]**

#### Responsibilities:
- **Database Design**: Design the relational database structure using MySQL to support the application’s functionality.
- **Data Integrity & Security**: Ensure data is secure, backed up, and maintained with high integrity.
- **Database Integration**: Integrate MySQL with the Laravel backend to manage data and transactions.
- **Optimization**: Write optimized queries to handle high traffic and large-scale data.
- **Database Troubleshooting**: Identify and resolve issues related to database performance or data corruption.
- **Schema Design**: Design the schema, tables, and relationships between them.
- **Reviewing Diagrams**: The Database Developer will also review all the system diagrams (use case, sequence, activity, class, component, deployment) to ensure database flow and structure align with the system design and business requirements.

## ✅ Plan Forward
🔜 **Start Date**: After the Signals Quiz (Sunday)  
⏱ **Timeline**: 3 weeks (tight deadline – full focus mode)  
📈 After implementation, we’ll all present and explain our parts to each other. Since our work will be interconnected, we’ll already have strong familiarity with the full system.

🧠 **Tools & Workflow**:  
We’ll be using GitHub branches for collaboration:
- Each developer will work on their own branch.
- Use pull requests for merging with the main branch.
- Follow clean commit messages and regularly push progress.
- Weekly merges and code reviews to stay in sync.

Let’s aim for clean, professional, working code.  
**WENABYYYYYYYYY 💥🔥**
