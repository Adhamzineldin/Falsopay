# FalsoPay Testing Plan

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the testing strategy for the FalsoPay payment system. The plan covers various testing methodologies including unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing.

## 2. Testing Objectives

- Verify that all system components function as expected
- Ensure the security of financial transactions
- Validate system performance under expected load
- Confirm compatibility with target devices and browsers
- Verify compliance with financial regulations and standards

## 3. Testing Scope

### In Scope
- Backend API endpoints
- Database operations
- Frontend user interfaces
- Integration with external banking systems
- Security mechanisms
- Performance under load

### Out of Scope
- Third-party service internals
- Hardware infrastructure testing
- Penetration testing (to be conducted separately)

## 4. Testing Types

### 4.1 Unit Testing

**Objective**: Test individual components in isolation

**Approach**:
- White-box testing of key functions
- Path coverage for critical methods
- Mock external dependencies

**Tools**:
- PHPUnit for backend
- Jest for frontend

### 4.2 Integration Testing

**Objective**: Test interactions between components

**Approach**:
- Test API endpoints with actual database
- Verify correct data flow between components
- Test error handling between components

**Tools**:
- Postman for API testing
- Cypress for frontend-backend integration

### 4.3 System Testing

**Objective**: Test the complete system

**Approach**:
- Black-box testing of system features
- Boundary value analysis
- Equivalence partitioning

**Tools**:
- Cypress for end-to-end testing
- JMeter for load testing

### 4.4 Acceptance Testing

**Objective**: Verify system meets business requirements

**Approach**:
- User acceptance testing with stakeholders
- Scenario-based testing of key workflows
- Usability testing

**Tools**:
- TestRail for test case management
- Manual testing

## 5. Test Environment

### 5.1 Development Environment
- Local development machines
- Development database
- Mocked external services

### 5.2 Testing Environment
- Dedicated test server
- Test database with sample data
- Sandboxed external services

### 5.3 Staging Environment
- Production-like environment
- Anonymized production data
- Test instances of external services

## 6. Test Deliverables

- Test plan (this document)
- Test cases
- Test scripts
- Test data
- Test reports
- Defect reports
- Test summary

## 7. Testing Schedule

| Phase | Start Date | End Date | Deliverables |
|-------|------------|----------|--------------|
| Test Planning | Week 1 | Week 2 | Test plan, test cases |
| Unit Testing | Week 3 | Week 4 | Unit test reports |
| Integration Testing | Week 5 | Week 6 | Integration test reports |
| System Testing | Week 7 | Week 8 | System test reports |
| Acceptance Testing | Week 9 | Week 10 | UAT sign-off |

## 8. Risk Analysis

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Integration issues with banking APIs | Medium | High | Early integration testing, fallback mechanisms |
| Performance issues under load | Medium | High | Load testing, performance optimization |
| Security vulnerabilities | Low | Critical | Security testing, code reviews, encryption |
| Database corruption | Low | Critical | Backup procedures, transaction integrity checks |
| Browser compatibility issues | Medium | Medium | Cross-browser testing, responsive design |

## 9. Entry and Exit Criteria

### 9.1 Entry Criteria
- Requirements are finalized and approved
- Test environment is set up
- Test data is available
- Test cases are prepared

### 9.2 Exit Criteria
- All planned tests have been executed

- Test environment becomes unavailable
- Major changes to requirements

### 10.2 Resumption Criteria
- Critical defects have been fixed
- Test environment is restored
- Requirement changes have been incorporated
