# 3. System Design

## 3.1 Architectural Patterns

FalsoPay implements a combination of architectural patterns to create a robust, scalable, and maintainable payment system. Below are the key architectural patterns used and the rationale behind each choice:

### Microservices Architecture

FalsoPay is built using a microservices architecture, which divides the application into loosely coupled, independently deployable services.

**Why this pattern?**
- **Scalability**: Each service can be scaled independently based on demand
- **Resilience**: Failure in one service doesn't bring down the entire system
- **Technology Flexibility**: Different services can use different technologies based on specific requirements
- **Independent Development**: Teams can work on different services simultaneously without tight coordination
- **Easier Maintenance**: Smaller, focused codebases are easier to understand and maintain

### API Gateway Pattern

An API Gateway serves as the single entry point for all client requests, routing them to appropriate microservices.

**Why this pattern?**
- **Simplified Client Interface**: Clients only need to know about a single endpoint
- **Security**: Centralized authentication and authorization
- **Cross-cutting Concerns**: Handles common functionality like logging, rate limiting, and monitoring
- **Protocol Translation**: Can translate between web protocols and internal protocols
- **Request Aggregation**: Can combine results from multiple services for a single client request

### Event-Driven Architecture

FalsoPay uses event-driven architecture for handling transactions and notifications.

**Why this pattern?**
- **Decoupling**: Services communicate through events without direct dependencies
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Enables handling of high-volume transactions without blocking
- **Real-time Updates**: Facilitates immediate notifications for account activities
- **Audit Trail**: Events provide a natural audit log for all system activities
- **Scalability**: Easily scales to handle varying loads of transactions

### CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

The system separates read operations (queries) from write operations (commands).

**Why this pattern?**
- **Performance Optimization**: Read and write operations can be optimized separately
- **Scalability**: Read-heavy operations can be scaled independently from write operations
- **Security**: Easier to implement different security models for reads vs. writes
- **Simplified Models**: Simpler domain models for specific operations

## 3.2 System Architecture

The FalsoPay system consists of the following major components:

1. **User Management Service**
   - Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management
   - Manages user roles and permissions

2. **Payment Processing Service**
   - Processes money transfers between accounts
   - Handles different payment methods
   - Implements transaction security measures

3. **Account Management Service**
   - Manages bank account linking
   - Handles balance inquiries
   - Processes transaction limits

4. **Notification Service**
   - Sends transaction confirmations
   - Delivers security alerts
   - Manages notification preferences

5. **Transaction History Service**
   - Stores and retrieves transaction records
   - Provides filtering and search capabilities
   - Generates transaction reports

6. **Security Service**
   - Implements PIN verification
   - Manages transaction blocking/unblocking
   - Detects suspicious activities

7. **Customer Support Service**
   - Handles support ticket creation and management
   - Provides system status information
   - Manages user reports

8. **API Gateway**
   - Routes client requests to appropriate services
   - Handles authentication and authorization
   - Implements rate limiting and monitoring

9. **Event Bus**
   - Facilitates asynchronous communication between services
   - Ensures reliable event delivery
   - Supports event sourcing for audit trails

### Integration Points

FalsoPay integrates with several external systems:

1. **Banking APIs**
   - For bank account verification
   - For processing transfers to/from bank accounts

2. **Payment Networks**
   - For processing card payments
   - For interoperability with other payment systems

3. **Regulatory Compliance Systems**
   - For KYC (Know Your Customer) verification
   - For AML (Anti-Money Laundering) checks

### Deployment Architecture

FalsoPay uses a cloud-native deployment approach:

1. **Containerization**: All services are containerized using Docker
2. **Orchestration**: Kubernetes manages container deployment and scaling
3. **Infrastructure as Code**: Terraform scripts define and provision infrastructure
4. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated testing and deployment processes
5. **Multi-region Deployment**: For high availability and disaster recovery

### Security Architecture

Security is implemented at multiple levels:

1. **Network Level**: Firewalls, VPNs, and network segmentation
2. **Application Level**: Input validation, output encoding, and secure coding practices
3. **Data Level**: Encryption at rest and in transit
4. **Identity Level**: Multi-factor authentication and role-based access control
5. **Monitoring Level**: Intrusion detection and security information and event management

## 3.3 Class Classification

FalsoPay's classes are categorized into the following classifications:

1. **Entity Classes**
   - User
   - Transaction
   - BankAccount
   - Card
   - SupportTicket
   - Notification

2. **Boundary Classes**
   - UserInterface
   - APIGateway
   - PaymentProcessor
   - NotificationSender
   - ReportGenerator

3. **Control Classes**
   - AuthenticationController
   - TransactionController
   - AccountController
   - NotificationController
   - SecurityController

4. **Service Classes**
   - UserService
   - TransactionService
   - AccountService
   - NotificationService
   - SecurityService

5. **Repository Classes**
   - UserRepository
   - TransactionRepository
   - AccountRepository
   - NotificationRepository
   - SecurityRepository

## 3.4 Interaction Patterns

The system employs several key interaction patterns:

1. **Request-Response**: Used for synchronous operations like balance inquiries
2. **Publish-Subscribe**: Used for notifications and event propagation
3. **Command-Query**: Implementing CQRS for optimized data operations
4. **Observer Pattern**: For real-time updates of transaction status
5. **Chain of Responsibility**: For processing transaction validations

## 3.5 Design Patterns

FalsoPay implements several design patterns:

1. **Factory Method**: For creating different types of payment methods
2. **Singleton**: For global services like authentication and logging
3. **Strategy**: For implementing different transaction processing algorithms
4. **Observer**: For notification handling
5. **Decorator**: For adding security layers to transactions
6. **Adapter**: For integrating with different banking APIs
7. **Facade**: For simplifying complex subsystems
8. **Command**: For encapsulating transaction operations
