title "UC-35: Check System Status"

actor "Admin" as admin
participant "Admin Portal" as portal
participant "API Gateway" as gateway
participant "Monitoring\nService" as monitorService
participant "System\nComponents" as components
database "Metrics\nDatabase" as metricsDB

== Main Success Scenario ==

admin -> portal: Access system dashboard
portal -> gateway: Request system status
gateway -> monitorService: Forward status request

monitorService -> components: Poll status of all components
components --> monitorService: Status responses

monitorService -> metricsDB: Query recent performance metrics
metricsDB --> monitorService: Return performance data

monitorService -> monitorService: Aggregate status information
monitorService -> monitorService: Calculate health indicators
monitorService -> gateway: Return system status overview
gateway -> portal: Forward status information

portal -> portal: Render status dashboard
portal -> admin: Display status overview

admin -> portal: Select component for detailed view
portal -> gateway: Request component details
gateway -> monitorService: Forward component detail request
monitorService -> metricsDB: Query detailed component metrics
metricsDB --> monitorService: Return detailed metrics
monitorService -> gateway: Return component details
gateway -> portal: Forward component details

portal -> portal: Render detailed component view
portal -> admin: Display component details

== Alternative Scenario: System Components Unreachable ==

admin -> portal: Access system dashboard
portal -> gateway: Request system status
gateway -> monitorService: Forward status request

monitorService -> components: Poll status of all components
note over monitorService, components: Some components unreachable

monitorService -> metricsDB: Query last known status
metricsDB --> monitorService: Return last known data with timestamps

monitorService -> monitorService: Aggregate available status information
monitorService -> monitorService: Mark unreachable components
monitorService -> gateway: Return partial system status
gateway -> portal: Forward status information

portal -> portal: Render status dashboard with warnings
portal -> admin: Display status overview with alerts for unreachable components
portal -> admin: Show last known status with timestamps for unreachable components
