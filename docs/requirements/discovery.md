# Requirements Discovery Approaches

We plan to use the following techniques:

1. **Interviews**:
    - Team brainstorming sessions to gather assumptions and expectations.
    - Hypothetical interviews with "student users" and "admins" to simulate use cases.

2. **Scenario-Based Analysis**:
    - Create end-to-end user scenarios like "User registers and transfers money" or "Admin suspends a fraudulent user" to drive out specific requirements.

3. **Prototyping**:
    - Build quick UI wireframes in Figma to simulate the app flow and get early feedback.
    - Interactive mock-ups will highlight key features and help refine expectations.

4. **Document Analysis**:
    - Use existing fintech applications like InstaPay for reference on essential workflows, security features, and terminology.

5. **Workshops**:
    - Internal team workshops to resolve conflicting ideas and define priority flows.
