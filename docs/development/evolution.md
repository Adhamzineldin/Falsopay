# System Evolution

## Anticipated Changes
- Addition of new payment methods (e.g., crypto wallets or QR payments).
- Integration with external bank APIs for real-time bank account access.
- Scalability to support thousands of concurrent users.
- Multilingual support for wider accessibility.
- Mobile application development for iOS and Android.

## Handling Future Changes
- Use of **modular design patterns** to allow easy plug-in of future features.
- Maintain a clear **API contract** for backend-to-frontend communication to prevent breaking changes.
- Write **scalable database schemas** with indexing and normalization.
- Use of **.env** configuration files to adapt to different deployment environments.
- Maintain **comprehensive documentation and code comments** to assist future developers in understanding legacy code.
