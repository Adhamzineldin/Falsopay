# FalsoPay Testing Summary

This document provides an overview of the testing performed on the FalsoPay system, including code quality metrics, white-box testing, and black-box testing.

## Overview

The FalsoPay payment system has been subjected to comprehensive testing to ensure its reliability, security, and performance. This testing includes:

1. **Software Quality Factor Analysis**: Examining interdependencies between quality attributes
2. **Code Complexity Metrics**: Measuring various complexity metrics to identify potential issues
3. **White-Box Testing**: Testing internal paths through key functions
4. **Black-Box Testing**: Testing functionality from an external perspective

## Key Functions Tested

The following key functions were selected for detailed testing:

1. `TransactionController::sendMoney()` - Core money transfer functionality
2. `AuthController::login()` - User authentication
3. `BankAccountController::linkAccountToService()` - Bank account linking
4. `User::createUser()` - User registration
5. `BankAccount::getBalance()` - Balance checking
6. `Transaction::createTransaction()` - Transaction creation

## Testing Coverage

| Testing Approach | Coverage |
|------------------|----------|
| White-Box Testing | 100% path coverage for 6 key functions |
| Black-Box Testing | Boundary testing for all input parameters |
| Code Complexity Analysis | 6 classes analyzed with 6 metrics each |

## Key Findings

### Software Quality Factors

Several pairs of software quality factors show interdependencies:
- Security vs. Usability
- Performance vs. Reliability
- Maintainability vs. Efficiency
- Portability vs. Security

### Code Complexity

- **Highest Complexity**: `TransactionController::sendMoney()` with CCM of 12
- **Highest Coupling**: `TransactionController` with CBO of 10
- **Best Cohesion**: Model classes with LCOM of 0

### Testing Results Summary

| Function | White-Box Test Cases | Black-Box Test Cases | Notable Issues |
|----------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------|
| `sendMoney()` | 9 | 7 | High complexity, multiple validation paths |
| `login()` | 6 | 6 | Multiple authentication paths |
| `linkAccountToService()` | 6 | 7 | Multiple validation steps |
| `createUser()` | 3 | 9 | Duplicate checks important |
| `getBalance()` | 2 | 6 | Edge cases with amount values |
| `getAllByUserId()` | 2 | 6 | Performance with large result sets |

## Recommendations

Based on the testing results, we recommend:

1. **Refactoring Complex Functions**: 
   - Consider breaking down `TransactionController::sendMoney()` into smaller, more focused methods
   - Reduce coupling in the `TransactionController` class

2. **Improved Validation**:
   - Add consistent validation for numeric inputs (amounts, PINs)
   - Standardize error responses across all endpoints

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Add pagination for endpoints that return large datasets
   - Consider caching for frequently accessed data

4. **Security Enhancements**:
   - Review PIN verification process
   - Add rate limiting for authentication attempts

5. **Additional Testing**:
   - Implement automated regression testing
   - Add load testing for transaction processing

## Next Steps

1. Address the issues identified in the testing reports
2. Implement continuous integration with automated tests
3. Conduct regular security audits
4. Monitor system performance in production
