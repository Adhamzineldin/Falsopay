# Design & Implementation Constraints

- **Technology Stack Constraint**: We are limited to using Laravel (PHP) for the backend and React for the frontend as per project requirements.
- **Database Constraint**: The system will use SQLite as the primary relational database.
- **Time Constraint**: The project must be completed in 3 weeks, limiting the complexity of features.
- **Security Constraint**: All user data must be stored securely, requiring JWT, hashed passwords, and HTTPS enforcement.
- **Team Roles Constraint**: Each team member has fixed responsibilities (e.g., frontend/backend), so task delegation must align with skill sets.
- **Deployment Constraint**: The application must be deployed so users can use it.
