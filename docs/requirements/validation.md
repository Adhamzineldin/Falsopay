# Requirements Validation Techniques

We will use the following validation strategies:

1. **Reviews and Inspections**:
    - Peer review of documented requirements for clarity, consistency, and feasibility.
    - Validation sessions where team members cross-check others' work (e.g., DB dev reviews diagrams).

2. **Prototyping Feedback**:
    - Validate key functionalities through clickable UI prototypes and simulated workflows.
    - Adjust requirements based on feedback from interactive testing.

3. **Test Case Derivation**:
    - Write early test cases based on the requirements to ensure they are testable and specific (especially non-functional ones).

4. **Use Case Walkthroughs**:
    - Walk through each use case with the team and verify every actorâ€™s interaction is covered.
    - Helps uncover missed edge cases and refine flows.

5. **Checklists**:
    - Maintain validation checklists per requirement (e.g., security, performance) to ensure nothing is overlooked before implementation.
